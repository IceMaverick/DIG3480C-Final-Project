	<h1>Wit's Castle Raid</h1>
	<h4>Wit is your average, giant-haired dude with superpowers just trying to make his way in this world.<br>
	However, even the best of us find ourselves a little short on change now and again.<br>
	So, like any reasonable person would do, Wit set out on an adventure to plunder a castle<br>
	in hopes of finding something to pay for dinner tonight.</h4>
	<br><br><br><br><h5>Use the Arrow Keys to Move.<br><br>
	Your character, Wit, can surge up walls <br>
	by holding jump while running into them.<br><br>
	Wit can also cling to ceilings<br>
	by holding the jump button.</h5>
