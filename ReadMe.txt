Produced for DIG3480C Final Exam Project.

Thanks to my professor (who shall remain anonymous) for providing such a fun and knowledge-filled class and for giving me so many helping hands in figuring out what code I need. Equal thanks to my lab instructor for being so willing to discuss ideas and help me figure out how to go about implementing them. You two were great instructors and I learned more in this class than any I have taken to date.
